Thanks for your interest in pp-fastsim-sbi!

## Dev setup
- Use Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended).
- Create a virtual env (conda/mamba/venv).
- Run tests with `pytest`.

## Workflow
1. Branch from `main` using `feat/*`, `fix/*`, or `docs/*`.
2. Keep commits small and clear.
3. Add/update tests for code changes.

## Data policy
- Keep the repo small. Put only tiny sample data in `data/`.
- Large runs should live outside the repo and be referenced by path.
